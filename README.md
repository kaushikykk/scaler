Basic DSA problems:
Array manipulation (reversing, searching, sorting)
Linked list operations (insertion, deletion, traversal)
Stack and queue implementations
Tree traversal (in-order, pre-order, post-order)
Graph algorithms (DFS, BFS)
Moderate to advanced DSA problems:
Dynamic programming problems (Fibonacci sequence, longest common subsequence)
Greedy algorithms (activity selection problem, fractional knapsack)
Backtracking algorithms (N-Queens problem, Sudoku solver)
Bit manipulation techniques
Design questions:
Designing data structures for specific use cases (like a cache, a frequency counter)
Optimizing algorithms for performance
System design questions (for more advanced tracks):
Designing a scalable web service
Handling large data volumes
Key aspects of Scaler assignments:
Emphasis on code quality:
Beyond just getting the correct answer, Scaler evaluates your code for efficiency, readability, and proper handling of edge cases.
Time complexity analysis:
You are usually expected to explain the time complexity of your solution in terms of Big O notation.
Explanation of approach:
Many assignments require you to write a detailed explanation of your thought process and the reasoning behind your algorithm choice.
